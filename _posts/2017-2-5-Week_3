# What did you do this past week?

This last week, I 

# What's in your way?

One prboblem I find in front of me is my inexperience in Python. Many of the data structures are used and setup in different ways that I am familiar with. Python has no set types and much of Python seesm to be formally unstructured, so it is difficult to figure out what to do, and how to implement certain algorithms and structures. 

# What will you do next week?

Next week, I will continue to learn about Python so that I will find a method of implementing a cache that can deal with my Collatz program. Hopefully, I will be able to complete the project and turn it in with a maximized cache, along with all the assignment specifications.

# Class Experience

I learned in class this week is that Python is odd and different. It is different from what I am familiar with, and it is setup in a curious way. Types and Subclass inheritance is not a foreign concept to typical object oriented programming, but applying it to Python will take some time. We began talking about data structures in Python and their mutability, and I think doing more in depth in that quicker will help my understanding of Python and ease my stress about the projects. Additionally, I enjoy the section of class where we are asked to implement functions on paper, something I have not done in a while. It is a refreshing experience and a review-style application of my own skills.

# Tip Of The Week
With Career Fair approaching, and the scramble for internships and jobs about to begin, I'd like to introduce anybody who hasn't yet heard of it to HackerRank. HackerRank is a great website application that supplies problem sets for programmers to solve to improve their skills. The website covers all sorts of techniques and offers a great review for a vast variety of concepts that are important to software engineering.

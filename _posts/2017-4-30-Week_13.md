# What did you do this past week?

This past week, my group worked hard to finish up and finalize our IDB Game Database website. I think we did a great job, by covering all the necessary requirement, but also creating an interesting and beautiful webpage. Also, I created a lecture about MyPy, which is a tool that allows the option to set static typing in python scripts, for easier machine type checking to find and prevent errors in large projects easily. 

# What's in your way?

The only thing in my way now is my own schedule and my self-management. The end of the semester is approaching quickly, and for the software enginnering class, we are done with all of our projects, and the big thing to worry about is the last test, which I hope to overprepare for in hopes of a good grade. In the mean time, I will need to keep up with the quizzzes, and all the other little assignments, to ensure I do anything possible that I can to attain a good grade.

# What will you do next week?

Next week, I will continue to progress as I have, but I will look forward to the test, and start preparing early for that. Other classes are laying heavier burdens now, so I will really have to prioritize and schedule myself in a manner to maintain a balance so that I may be able to complete all of the piled up work that has been placed on me.

# Class Experience

In class we are beginning to talk about Factories and Prototypes, and topic concerning the overall structure of class usage. It seems that we are moving away from python specifically, and more towards java to more easily portray the effects of these topics. They are all new topics, but explained in a simple but engaging manner to help us absorb the material, so that it is understandable and retainable to new audiences.

# Tip Of The Week

As presented in class, Mypy is a great python tool that allows for optional static type checking.

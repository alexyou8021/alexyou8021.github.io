# What did you do this past week?

This week, I attended my first class of Software Engineering, and all in all, it was exciting, it was different, and it was filled with an abundance of new technologies and ideas to learn about. We were assigned a project about a Collatz problem, which creates a pattern of numbers by performing specific calculations to a number based on its parity. I spent time reading up, and learning about the pattern, and came to conclusion that the variance is very high and would be too difficult to find a pattern by hand. So, I began on the project by trying to jump right into the algorithm. However, I realized that to be efficient and to follow the given directions, I had to learn and implement many new technologies and connect it to my GitHub repository. I had my private repository setup with all the given code, and began creating issues to track my progress. Then, I tried to integrate Travis CI, which I found some problems setting up.

# What's in your way?

Along the way, I began finding issues with much of the technology I was working with because most of it was new to me. When I tried to connect Travis CI to my private repository, I found my biggest issue. It seems that a bug occurred that Travis CI would not install the correct version of Python libraries because I was lacking a requirements.txt file, and therefore made a non-working red build on Travis CI. I have posted on Piazza, and am prepared to continue building on my progress next week.

# What will you do next week?

Next week, I will begin reading the assigned textbook chapters, and prepare for the class on a biweekly basis. In regards to the Collatz project, I will try to figure out all the logistics of the project in terms of integration and setup, so I can begin solving the Collatz algorithm.

# Class Experience

Entering into my first two classes of Software Engineering, I was engaged by the topics and the professor. An interesting trait of Professor Fraij's class is his active engagement with the class. The way he calls on students to answer questions keeps me on my toes as I typically would not be a vocally engaged participant. So personally, I think it will help my learning overall. Something that shocked me about the class was the first quiz. The topics were difficult, either in material or simply new to me. Some of the topics were completely new to me so hopefully, I get more familiar with those types of questions and get more accustomed to these types of quizzes.

# Tip Of The Week
This is a website tool that I use to learn about all the programming languages or methods that I am unfamiliar with. If anyone else is like me, new to python, or wants to learn or refresh some topics, [https://www.tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com) is a great resource to do so.
